# MemoryEmu
Emulates the basics of human memory

This project is intended to be a start to understanding how people store and recall memories. Memories are stored as "Events", which are made up of "Frames". These Frames are intended to represent images and hopefully will eventually be represented by image files, but are currently string descriptions of a single action. Each Event contains a series of Frames, and are fairly simple. The interesting part of this program is how the memory access works. The Memory.remember method is supposed to return the single most "relevant" event in memory. Each event is scored by relevance, which is made up of several parts. One part is the keyword(s) that is passed into the remember function(aka remembering when a certain thing happened or a certain item was seen). The other part is the weight of the event. When instantiated, each Event is given a weight of 10, and each time any event is remembered, all events have their weights reduced, except for the event that was returned, which has its weight increased. This is intended to represent memories degrading over time unless they are actively remembered or maintained. Eventually, one goal of this project is that the program should be able to infer how an event will continue based on its memory of past events.
